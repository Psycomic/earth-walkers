* Earth Walkers

** Rendering

   I used opengl to create a debug draw of the scene.

** TODO The physics engine

   This is probably the longest component to create.

   To do:
   + Convex collision detection
   + Terrain collision detection
   + Collision response and physics


*** The representation of a convex shape

    The shape will be represented as all the vertices and the normal vectors of
    the faces.

    Example of a cube :

    #+BEGIN_SRC c
    Vector3 vertices[] = {
      {-1.f, -1.f, -1.f},
      ...
    };
    #+END_SRC
